## Experience
**Data Science Intern @ Kohl's (_June 2024 - August 2024_)**
-	Completed a technical proof-of-concept for an AI-powered virtual try-on experience to lift conversion rates, reduce return rates, and increase revenue per visitor.
-	Experimented with generative AI models, such as various stable diffusion models, control nets, and GANs.
-	Researched and completed a competitor analysis for virtual try-on experiences to support the exploration of AI-based try-on.

**Program Management Intern @ Bloom Energy (_June 2023 - August 2023_)**
-	Collaborated with engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain to build multiple Tableau dashboards to track the development of products, which improved program efficiency and the ability to give live production updates.

**Business Analyst Intern @ Amazon (_May 2022 - August 2022_)**
-	Utilized industry and company data at Amazon Games to develop 3 business strategy proposals for Amazon’s future in the metaverse.
-	Explored models (LSTM, FB Prophet, ARIMA) to predict sales of Amazon’s licensed games.

**Supply Chain Application Analyst Intern @ McKesson (_May 2021 - August 2021_)**
-	Using agile methodology, developed areas of McKesson’s transportation management system so business units could manage complicated courier contracts in one application.
-	Utilized Angular and Spring (Java Framework) for web development.


## Projects
**Low-Resource Machine Translation: Tigrinya | MIDS | Summer 2024**

[Code Repository](https://github.com/hsabraham28/mids-nlp-final-proj)

Experimented with LSTM, BERT, mT5, and M2M100 models to translate from English to Tigrinya with limited data. Succeeded in showing that quality translation is possible with pretrained embeddings of a language from a similar family and fine-tuning on low-resource language data.

**AI-Generated Image Detection | MIDS | Spring 2024**

[Code Repository](https://github.com/hsabraham28/mids_207_final_project)

Experimented with 12 different machine learning models to distinguish between real and AI-generated images.

**Predicting Insurance Charges | 2024**

[Code Repository](https://github.com/hsabraham28/datacamp-projects/tree/main/Predicting%20Insurance%20Charges)

Linear Regression model to predict customer healthcare costs based on DataCamp dataset of insurance charges with customer age, sex, smoker indication, number of children, bmi, and region.

**Predicting Ideal Crop for Agriculture | 2024**

[Code Repository](https://github.com/hsabraham28/datacamp-projects/tree/main/Ideal%20Crop%20Prediction%20for%20Agriculture)

Logistic Regression model to predict the ideal crop to grow based on Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphorus, and pH levels in the soil. The project also explores the business case of which soil feature to use for prediction if the farmer can only afford to measure one soil metric.
